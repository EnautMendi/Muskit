# Muskit: A Mutation Analysis Tool for Quantum Software Testing
# Description of the framework
Quantum software testing is a new area of research. Thus, there is a lack of benchmark programs and bugs repositories to assess the effectiveness of testing techniques. To this end, quantum mutation analysis focuses on systematically generating a set of faulty versions of quantum programs, called mutants, using mutation operators. Such faulty versions of quantum programs can be used as benchmarks to assess the quality of test cases in a test suite. Thus, we present Muskit -- a quantum mutation analysis tool for quantum programs coded in IBM's Qiskit language. Muskit implements  a set of mutation operators on gates of QPs and a set of selection criteria to reduce the number of mutants to generate. Moreover, it allows for the execution of test cases on mutants and generation of results for test analyses. Muskit is provided as a command line application, a GUI application, and also as a web application. 

# How to use
Since the mutants are Qiskit based the program you upload has to be only in Qiskit, without any python code. The code has to be structured in a secuential way without function definition, neither main or sub functions. The qubits and should be declared in once and in order to measure all the Qubits correctly the clasical bits has to be the same cuantiti as Qubits. In this link you can see an example program of how should be structured Example link.
